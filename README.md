# tnt2
This is a new version of tnt where I used OOP concepts of Python. The result is cleaner more maintainable code. 
It also supports simple xor encryption, which I plan to upgrade to AES or RSA, but probably AES algorithm.

TODO:

1. Upgrade the encryption to use the AES algorithm because xor is very week.
2. Finish implementing the Edit drop menu commands. 
3. Implement Networking? - I currently dont see the usefulness of networking in this app.
 - But it would be cool if I had a webserver housing the notes.

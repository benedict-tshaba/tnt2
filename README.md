# tnt2
This is a new version of tnt where I used OOP concepts of Python. The result is cleaner more maintainable code. 
It also supports simple xor encryption, which I plan to upgrade to AES or RSA, but probably AES algorithm.

TODO:
##############################################################################
1. Upgrade the encryption to use the AES algorithm because xor is very week.
2. Implement Networking? - I currently dont see the usefulness of networking in this app.
 - But it would be cool if I had a webserver housing the notes.

INSTALL:
    git clone git@github.com:benedict-tshaba/tnt2.git && cd tnt2
    sudo python setup.py install
